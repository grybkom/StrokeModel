# Stroke Prediction Models
Machine Learning Models for Stroke Prediction
---

## Background
The focus of this project is to build supervised models that predict stroke. 
Stroke is when there is an abrupt disruption of blood flow to the brain. 
This is caused by blood vessel blockage, narrowing or bursting. 
According to the Nation Institutes of Health (NIH), nearly 800,000 Americans suffer a 
stroke every year, with some of these cases being fatal. 
If an individual survives a stroke, the neurological effects can be mild to severe, 
and may include cognitive decline, movement problems and emotional dysregulation. 
The NIH lists several risk factors for stroke, some of which are unmodifiable, 
and some can be modified.
